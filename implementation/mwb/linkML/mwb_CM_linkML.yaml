classes:
  Constraint:
    class_uri: cccev:Constraint
    is_a: Requirement
    description: Limitation applied to an Information Concept. Additional Information:Constraints are Requirements in themselves, since they impose prerequisites which influence the definition, use and/or Fulfilment of the Requirement. They represent hard conditions such as minimum or maximum expressions which can be used to evaluate pieces of information, the required age, income, involvement in activities, etc. An example from the eProcurement domain is a threshold as the minimum turnover required by the buying Organisation to select the Candidates. Note that CCCEV does not provide any specific guidance on when which kind of Requirement should be used. Users of this vocabulary should make decisions on this topic in their specific context.
    attributes:
      hasThresholdValue:
        slot_uri: epo:hasThresholdValue
        description: The cut-off level for a given concept. Additional Information:This value is given as e.g. a minimum score, a maximum number of tenders with the highest score passing (see codelist at-voc:number-threshold).
        range: Decimal

        required: false
        multivalued: true

  Criterion:
    class_uri: cccev:Criterion
    is_a: Requirement
    description: Condition for evaluation or assessment. Additional Information:In general, Criteria are used for comparison, filtering or Selection purposes. Criteria usually set minimum conditions (e.g. limits, intervals, thresholds, etc.) that need to be met in order to pass the Requirements or to fulfil them to a certain degree or quality. The concept of Criteria is broader than the concept of Constraint since it covers more usages. The evaluation of the fulfilment is usually supported by the provision of Evidence. For example in the eProcurement domain, the eProcurement Ontology defines different subclasses of Criterion such as Exclusion Grounds, Selection Criteria or Award Criteria. A concrete example of a Criterion is 'participation in a criminal organisation' which could also be considered as an Exclusion Ground Criterion in the procurement domain or for requiring a public service.
    attributes:
      bias:
        slot_uri: cccev:bias
        description: Parameter used to adjust the evaluation of the Criterion. Additional Information:The bias parameter tries to correct a systematic error. For example in procurement, a home bias corresponds to the "presence of local preferences distorting international specialisation and resource allocation". When quantified, this systematic error can be removed.

        multivalued: false
      weight:
        slot_uri: cccev:weight
        description: Relative importance of the Criterion. Additional Information:The weight must be between 0 and 1. Usually, all Criteria can be integrated within a weighted sum equal to 1.

  Requirement:
    class_uri: cccev:Requirement
    description: Condition or prerequisite that is to be proven by Evidence. Additional Information:Requirement is a generic class representing any type of prerequisite that may be desired, needed or imposed as an obligation. CCCEV recommends to not use the Requirement class directly, but rather a more semantically-enriched subclass such as Criterion, Information Requirement or Constraint. Also note that the Requirement class is specified at a more abstract level and is not to be used as the instantiation of a Requirement for a specific Agent. To illustrate the notion:the European Directive on services in the internal market defines requirement as any obligation, prohibition, condition or limit provided for in the laws, regulations or administrative provisions of the Member States or in consequence of case-law, administrative practice, the rules of professional bodies, or the collective rules of professional associations or other professional Organisations, adopted in the exercise of their legal autonomy. To stay consistent to how identification is realised in the eProcurement ontology, we switch to using `adms:identifier` instead of `dct:identifier` as per CCCEV specification.

  Location:
    class_uri: dct:Location
    description: An identifiable geographic place or named place.
    attributes:
      geographicName:
        slot_uri: locn:geographicName
        description: A textual description for a Location. Additional Information:The INSPIRE Data Specification on Geographical Names provides a detailed model for describing a 'named place', including methods for providing multiple names in multiple scripts. This is beyond what is necessary for the Core Location Vocabulary but, importantly, the concept of a geographic name used here is consistent. A geographic name is a proper noun applied to a spatial object. Taking the example used in the INSPIRE document (page 15), the following are all valid geographic names for the Greek capital:- "Aθnνa"@gr-Grek (the Greek endonym written in the Greek script) - "Ath&#237;na"@gr-Latn (the standard Romanisation of the endonym) - "Athens"@en (the English language exonym) INSPIRE has a detailed (XML-based) method of providing metadata about a geographic name and in XML-data sets that may be the most appropriate method to follow. When using the Core Location Vocabulary in data sets that are not focussed on environmental/geographical data (the use case for INSPIRE), the Code datatype or a simple language identifier may be used to provide such metadata. The country codes defined in ISO 3166 may be used as geographic names and these are generally preferred over either the long form or short form of a country's name (as they are less error prone). The Publications Office of the European Union recommends the use of ISO 3166-1 codes for countries in all cases except two:- use 'UK' in preference to the ISO 3166 code GB for the United Kingdom; - use 'EL' in preference to the ISO 3166 code GR for Greece. Where a country has changed its name or no longer exists (such as Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia etc.) use the ISO 3166-3 code.

Attention will have to be paid in the future to possible inconsistencies derived from data placed in other classes and data held in the Statistical Information class; e.g. the TenderEvaluation class (see eEvaluation diagram) has the attribute admissibileTender indicator, which in case of being false, may enter in contradiction with the highest or lowest Tender value for that very same inadmissible Tender.

  Address:
    class_uri: locn:Address
    description: The particulars of the place where a Person or an Organisation is located. WG Approval 28/04/2020 Additional Information:An "Address Representation" as conceptually defined by the INSPIRE Address Representation data type:"Representation of an address spatial object for use in external application schemas that need to include the basic, address information in a readable way.". The representation of Addresses varies widely from one country's postal System to another. Even within countries, there are almost always examples of Addresses that do not conform to the stated national standard. At the time of publication, work is progressing on ISO 19160-1 that defines a method through which different Addresses can be converted from one conceptual model to another. This specification was heavily based on the INSPIRE Address Representation data type. It is noteworthy that if an Address is provided using the detailed breakdown suggested by the properties for this class, then it will be INSPIRE-conformant. To this very granular set of properties, we add two further properties:- full address (the complete address as a formatted string) - addressID (a unique identifier for the address) The first of these allows publishers to simply provide the complete Address as one string, with or without formatting. This is analogous to vCard's label property. The addressID is part of the INSPIRE guidelines and provides a hook that can be used to link the Address to an alternative representation, such as vCard or OASIS xAL.
    attributes:
      postName:
        slot_uri: locn:postName
        description: The key postal division of the address, usually the city. (INSPIRE's definition is "One or more names created and maintained for postal purposes to identify a subdivision of addresses and postal delivery points.) For example, "Paris".
        range: String

      addressArea:
        slot_uri: locn:addressArea
        description: The name or names of a geographic area or locality that groups a number of addressable objects for addressing purposes, without being an administrative unit. Additional Information:This would typically be part of a city, a neighbourhood or village, e.g. Montmartre.

      locatorName:
        slot_uri: locn:locatorName
        description: Proper noun(s) applied to the real world entity identified by the locator. Additional Information:The locator name could be the name of the property or complex, of the building or part of the building, or it could be the name of a room inside a building. The key difference between a locator and a locator name is that the latter is a proper name and is unlikely to include digits. For example, "Shumann, Berlaymont" is a meeting room within the European Commission headquarters for which locator name is more appropriate than locator.

        slot_uri: locn:adminUnitL2
        description: The name or names of a unit of administration related to the exercise of jurisdictional rights, for local, regional and national governance. Level 2 refers to the region of the address, usually a county, state or other such area that typically encompasses several localities. Additional Information:Some recommended codelists from the EU Publications Office include:Administrative Territorial Units (ATU), NUTS and Local Administrative Units (LAU). The first arrondissement of Paris is for example expressed as "http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/atu/FRA_AR_PAR01" in the ATU controlled vocabulary.

      fullAddress:
        slot_uri: locn:fullAddress
        description: The complete address written as a formatted string. Additional Information:Use of this property is recommended as it will not suffer any misunderstandings that might arise through the breaking up of an address into its component parts. This property is analogous to vCard's label property but with two important differences:(1) formatting is not assumed so that, unlike vCard label, it may not be suitable to print this on an address label, (2) vCard's label property has a domain of vCard Address; the fullAddress property has no such restriction. An example of a full address is "Champ de Mars, 5 Avenue Anatole France, 75007 Paris, France".

A locator may include more locator designators. Additional Information:In simpler terms, this is the building number, apartment number, etc. For an address such as "Flat 3, 17 Bridge Street", the locator is "flat 3, 17".

        description: The name or names of a unit of administration related to the exercise of jurisdictional rights, for local, regional and national governance. Level 1 refers to the uppermost administrative unit for the address, almost always a country. Additional Information:Best practice is to use the ISO 3166-1 code but if this is inappropriate for the context, country names should be provided in a consistent manner to reduce ambiguity. For example, either write 'France' or 'FRA' consistently throughout the dataset and avoid mixing the two. The Country controlled vocabulary from the Publications Office can be reused for this.

If an authority code is needed for a country without assigned ISO code, an alphanumeric code is created in order to not confuse with ISO codes that are strictly alphabetic or numeric. A country code comparison is provided between ISO codes, IANA codes (Internet Country-code Top-level Domains) and TIR (Transport International par la Route) Vehicle system codes.
